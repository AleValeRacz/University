# Given an n * n square matrix with integer values, find the maximum length of a snake sequence.
# A snake sequence begins on the matrix's top row (coordinate (0, i), 0 <= i < n).
# Each element of the sequence, except the first one, must have a value Â±1 from the previous one and be located directly below,
# or directly to the right of the previous element. For example, element (i, j) can be succeded by one of the (i, j + 1) or (i + 1, j) elements.
# Display the length as well as the sequence of coordinates for one sequence of maximum length.
